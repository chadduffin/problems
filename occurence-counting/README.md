# Occurence Counting

Given a list of numbers L, create function that returns the n most frequently occuring numbers.

L = [1, 5, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 8, 3, 5]

Foo(L, 2) should return [1, 5].

Details
* The order of returned elements does not matter.
* The list is going to be very large, taking up to 50% of memory.
* The numbers in the list can be arbitrarily large.
* The list is not sorted.
