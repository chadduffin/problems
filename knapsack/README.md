# Knapsack Problem

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

The above description is from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).

Given a maximum weight of 7, and item data as follows:

  weights = [1, 3, 4, 5]
  values  = [1, 4, 5, 7]

Your program should output that the maximum value that you have is 9, and that is with the 2nd and 3rd items.

* There is only 1 of each item.
