# Smallest Range

Given N lists of numbers, find the smallest range of numbers that includes at least one number from each list.

L1 = [0,  4,  7, 12, 25, 27]
L2 = [1,  3,  9, 17, 35]
L3 = [5, 11, 23, 40]

Foo(L1, L2, L3) would return 3, from values 3 @ L2, 4 @ L1 and 5 @ L3.

Details
* The lists are sorted.
* The lists can be arbitrarily large.
